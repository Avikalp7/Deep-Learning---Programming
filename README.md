# Deep-Learning---Programming
Codes for the programming assignments in the Deep Learning course offered by IIT Kharagpur in Spring 2017.

## Assignment 1
This assignment involves basic Machine Learning related questions to brush up the concepts. The assignment involved iPython notebook with unsolved questions, I've only uploaded the notebook with solved questions, not the original assignment question notebook.

## Assignment 2
**Problem Statement**: Implement a simple 1 hidden layer MLP WITHOUT using any deep learning library for predicting MNIST images. It is allowed to use linear algebra libraries like numpy.

Some instructions for running the code are mentioned in the main.py file, mainly about the data required.

In this assignment, I have not implemented gradient descent with momentum or nesterov acceleration. I naively used sigmoid as an activation function, please consider using ReLU or some other in-favor activation function. Also, I did not preprocess the data, but I'm hopeful that scaling down to 0 to 1 can have some positive impact on performance.
